# Rust Learning

A collection of projects and exercises as I learn Rust. Each folder represents a different concept or project.

## Projects

- [hello_world](./hello_world) — My first Rust program
- [hello_cargo](./hello_cargo) — Learning Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager
- [guessing_game](./guessing_game) — A number guessing game
